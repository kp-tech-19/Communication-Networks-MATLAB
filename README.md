# Communication-Networks-MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of fundamental Communication Network algorithms and simulation experiments.  
Each experiment includes MATLAB scripts, simulation outputs, performance plots, and interpretation of results.

## Experiments

1. Stop and Wait Protocol  
2. Go Back N Protocol  
3. Selective Repeat Protocol  
4. Distance Vector Routing  
5. Link State Routing  
6. Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)  

## Getting Started

1. Open MATLAB  
2. Clone or download this repository  
3. Navigate to any experiment folder  
4. Run the corresponding `.m` file to simulate the experiment  
5. Generated plots are stored as `.png` files inside each experiment directory  

## Requirements

- MATLAB
